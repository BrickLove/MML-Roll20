MML-Roll20
==========

Work in progress. Started project without much of a concept of OOP or experience designing larger programs. This is a continuous process of learning while building.

All functions are my own with the exception of the Roll20 API calls found in MML_Utilities.js. I built wrappers around most of these functions for ease of use with the rest of the code.
