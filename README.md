MML-Roll20
==========

Work in progress. Started project without much of a concept of OOP or designing larger programs. Continuous process of updating obsolete code to fit within the refined design.

All functions are my own with the exception of the Roll20 API calls found in MML_Utilities.js. I built wrappers around most of these functions for ease of use with the rest of the code.
